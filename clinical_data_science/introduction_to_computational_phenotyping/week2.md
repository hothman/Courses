## Data types for computational phenotyping 

#### Algorithm performance 

* sensitivity 
* Specificity 
* positive predictive values (PPV)
* Negative predictive value (NPV)

Specificity measure how well the patient's actual condition was captured by the code.



Sensitivity is the true positive rate 
$$
TPR = \frac{TP}{TP+FN}
$$
Specificity is the false positive rate 
$$
FPR = \frac{FP}{FP+TN}
$$
PPV shows the percent of true positive from the total number of patient with the condition
$$
PPV = \frac{TP}{TP+FP}
$$
NPV shows the percent of true negative from the total number of patient that did not have the condition
$$
NPV = \frac{FN}{FN+TN}
$$
